# geo-data
Geo data is secondary repo supporting web functionality of kallejre/geo by offloading some static content.
At one point i discovered that operations with main repository https://github.com/kallejre/geo were becoming rather slow. Most of that was caused by keeping TMS tiles from one earlier project in the repository. This repo tries to prevent it by keeping rarely changed content separately.

## WARNING: This repo contains lot of small or very large, but mostly boring files
